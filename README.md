Mall Customer Clustering:_
This project focuses on segmenting mall customers into distinct groups based on their purchasing behavior and demographic data using clustering algorithms.

What I Have Done
Collected and included a dataset containing customer information such as age, income, and spending score.

Developed a Jupyter Notebook that:

Loads and explores the dataset.

Preprocesses the data by handling missing values and scaling features.

Applies clustering algorithms such as K-Means to identify customer segments.

Visualizes the clusters and interprets the results.

Published the project publicly on GitHub for others to explore and build upon.
