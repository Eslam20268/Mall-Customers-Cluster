# Mall Customer Clustering

This project focuses on segmenting mall customers into distinct groups based on their purchasing behavior and demographic data using clustering algorithms, mainly **K-Means**.

## What I Have Done

- Collected and included a dataset containing customer information such as **age, annual income, and spending score**.
- Developed a Jupyter Notebook that:
  - Loads and explores the dataset.
  - Preprocesses the data by handling missing values and scaling features to ensure fair clustering.
  - Applies clustering algorithms such as **K-Means** to identify meaningful customer segments.
  - Visualizes the clusters and interprets the results to provide actionable business insights.
- Published the project publicly on GitHub for others to explore and build upon.

## Why Customer Segmentation?
